The Source code for the UnmanagedDemo can be found in the folder 'Source'.

Full solution and project files can be found in the UnmanagedDemo directory.

The solution and project files here were built with the Visual Studio 11 Beta,
but should also be compatible with the newer Visual Studio 2012 release. 

All code files may of course be opened independently for inspection with any text
editor.

The source code can be compiled using a fresh project on an older version of 
visual studio, however it must be linked with the Box2D library.
