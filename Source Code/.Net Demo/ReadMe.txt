The Source code for the .Net Demo can be found in the folder 'Source'.

Full solution and project files can be found in the DotNetDemo directory.

The solution and project files here were built with the Visual Studio 10 
Professional. It may be necessary to install the XNA framework from 
http://xbox.create.msdn.com/en-us/resources/downloads

All code files may of course be opened independently for inspection with any text
editor.

The included Box2DXNA DLL will need to be referenced from the project.
