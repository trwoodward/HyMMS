The Source code for the HyMMS Library can be found in the folder 'Source'.

Full solution and project files can be found in the HyMMSFinalTest directory.

The solution and project files here were built with the Visual Studio 11 Beta,
but should also be compatible with the newer Visual Studio 2012 release. 

All code files may of course be opened independently for inspection with any text
editor.

The source code can be compiled using a fresh project on an older version of 
visual studio, however the unit tests will only work with a version that supports
the built in native unit testing environment: Visual Studio 11 Beta and newer.
